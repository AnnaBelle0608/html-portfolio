<p style="font-family:Calisto MT"><h1>Let me introduce myself!</h1></p>
<p style="font-size:120%"; style="font-family:Calisto MT">Hello! My name is Ashleigh. I'm a dedicated Web Developer, always learning and always looking for new things to learn.
  After working in an office setting for almost 10 years with nowhere to grow, I knew I needed a change.
  I've had an interest in coding and developing for a while and the more I used queries and functions within Google Sheets 
  and Excel, and got excited to make things work and automate; I knew the path I needed to go.
</p>

<p style="font-size:120%"; style="font-family:Calisto MT">When I'm not further developing my skills at the computer, I enjoy painting and doing crafts with my three boisterous boys.
  I have also always had a love for the outdoors so I get outside and enjoy nature as much as possible. I married my best friend
  in 2014 and he is as much my rock as I am his. Having similar interests in web programming, we like bouncing ideas off each
  other to either move past a problem or just come up with something better.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%"; style="font-family:Calisto MT">I've always had the belief that you should never stop learning and strive to implement that belief into my
  life on a very regular basis.
