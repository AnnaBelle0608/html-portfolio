<p><h1>Let me introduce myself!</h1></p>
  <hr>
<p>Hello! My name is Ashleigh. I'm a dedicated Web Developer, always learning and always looking for new things to learn.
  After working in an office setting for almost 10 years with nowhere to grow, I knew I needed a change.
  I've been interested in coding and developing for a while and the more I used queries and functions within Google Sheets
or Excel, the more I got excited to see things work and automate. It became a no-brainer on the path I needed to go.
</p>

<p>When I'm not further developing my skills at the computer, I enjoy painting and doing crafts with my three boisterous boys.
  I have also always loved the outdoors so I get outside and enjoy nature as much as possible. I married my best friend
  in 2014 and he is as much my rock as I am his. Having similar interests in web programming, we like bouncing ideas off each
  other to either move past a problem or just come up with something better.</p>

<p>I have always had the belief that you should never stop learning and I strive to implement that belief into my
  life on a very regular basis.
</p>
